Going through Rosalind problems for fun in order to maintain python skills acquired during my masters.

Additionally, attempting to improve coding style by incorporating best practices from various sources.
Including: 
1. Mastering Python for Bioinformatics (Ken Youns-Park, 2021)
2. ... (TBD)

In some cases there will be multiple answer files for the same question, intergrating different sylistic lessons/in ascending order of complexity.
